# Optical flow to detect vehcile and track its speed
This repository contains code to detect and track a moving vechilce using Sparse Optical Flow. The moving vechile is detected by taking the difference between two consecutive images, contour detection, SIFT feature matching, and pixel displacement. Achieved an accuracy of 99% for various speeds.

Results can be found in the "results" directory.
