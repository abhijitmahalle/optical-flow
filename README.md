# Optical flow to detect and track vehicle speed
This repository contains program to detect and track a moving vechilce using Sparse Optical Flow. The moving vechile is detected by taking difference of two consecutive images, contour detection, SIFT feature matching, and pixel displacement. Achieved an accuracy of 99% for various speeds.

Results can be found in the "results" directory.
